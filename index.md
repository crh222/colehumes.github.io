_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](10k_nlp_covid)**_

This project was designed to test the skills that we have learned up to this point in the semester. We were tasked with downloading information on company's within the S&P 500, both qualitative and quantitative. With this information we then analyzed Covid-19's effect on company's stock returns over a given period. Coupling this with how it related to risk measures that were previously defined by the student. The risk measures were a product of parsing individual company's 10-K's for keywords that related to the risk. This was used as a proxy for risk. The objective was then to see if these risk measures played a role in the company's performance.
