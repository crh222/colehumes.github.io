**Project description:** This project was designed to test the skills that we have learned up to this point in the semester. We were tasked with downloading information on company’s within the S&P 500, both qualitative and quantitative. With this information we then analyzed Covid-19’s effect on company’s stock returns over a given period. Coupling this with how it related to risk measures that were previously defined by the student. The risk measures were a product of parsing individual company’s 10-K’s for keywords that related to the risk. This was used as a proxy for risk. The objective was then to see if these risk measures played a role in the company’s performance.

  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
